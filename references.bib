@article{malenfantTutorialBehavioralReflection1996,
  title = {A {{Tutorial}} on {{Behavioral Reflection}} and Its {{Implementation}}},
  abstract = {The eecient implementation of behaviorally reeec-tive languages imposes a formidable challenge. By deenition, behavioral reeection allows a program to modify, e v en at run-time, its own code as well as the semantics and the implementation of its own programming language. This late-binding of the language semantics favors interpretive techniques, but compilers are absolutely necessary to make reeec-tive languages eecient and therefore of real interest. The goals of this tutorial are: 1 to give the picture of the state of the art in the eecient implementation of behavioral reeection, 2 to review the main issues in going from interpreter-based to compiler-based implementations and 3 to propose new avenues towards the realization of this objective. Our tutorial is aimed at a large audience of reeective language implementors, in either object-oriented, functional or even logic programming. To make our point widely applicable, we avoid ne-grain technicalities. Rather we emphasize the common denominator of all reeective languages, we propose a clear and general problem statement, and we set up a wide-ranging research agenda.},

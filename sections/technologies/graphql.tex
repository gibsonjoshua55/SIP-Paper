\subsection{GraphQL}
The main technology motivating this project is GraphQL, a query language developed by Facebook in 2012 \cite{byronKeynoteBriefHistory2019}.  This language, in comparison to querying languages such as SQL (Structured Query Language), is designed to be exposed as to the web as a public set of defined functions.  Due to security concerns, SQL has been secured and users have been prevented from sending SQL queries directly to a database.  This allows GraphQL to be a public Application Program Interface (API), which is essentially a contract of what functions are available for a given piece of software.  GraphQL servers can define the available queries and mutations for the server, and the client is then only allowed to request those functions to be run by the server.

\subsubsection{Language Structure}

The unique aspect of GraphQL is that when the client requests data from the API, the client requests the shape of the response.  This means that rather than the server defining the exact data that it will provide, the client has the freedom to adapt the data requested.

Another unique part of the language is that data accessible by the API is represented as a graph of connected data types.  You could imagine each type of requestable data being a node on a graph where the edges represent relationships between the data.  When combining the ability to dynamically request data from the server and being able to request related data, the power of GraphQL becomes evident.  Since the client requests exactly what it wants and can receive all the related data in one request, the number of requests to the server is dramatically reduced and no extraneous data is sent to the client.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:schema-graph} is a visual representation of a GraphQL schema with three types, TimestampCollection, TimestampCollectionLabel, and Timestamp.  The edges between each type show that relationships exist between the types. These relationships  would allow the user to create a request as shown in Figure \ref{fig:basic-query}.  The result of this query would be all TimestampCollections with their associated labels and timestamps.  If some of those requests fields or connected data not are needed, however, any part of that query could be removed and the API would respond with less data.

\begin{figure}
    \begin{verbatim}
query {
    timestampCollections {
        identity
        title
        labels {
            title
            timestamps {
                time
            }
        }
    }
}
    \end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{GraphQL vs. SQL}

SQL is debatably one of the most popular querying languages thanks to the popularity of relational databases, which will be discussed more below.  While the aim of this project is to connect GraphQL and SQL queries, it should be noted that the two languages exist for very different reasons.

SQL is a language very strongly tied to the storage and retrieval of data.  Queries act on specific tables that have strictly defined and structured data.  The SQL language does not make sense outside of the context of a relational database.  GraphQL on the other hand is completely agnostic to how the data is stored/retrieved.  The data source could be a relational database, a non-relational database, some other API, or could be programmatically generated. To fetch and update all of this data, GraphQL servers implement functions called resolvers that "resolve" the requested information from a data source.  That data source may be a  database, some other function in the code base, or calling another remote service..  Because of this flexibility, it is possible to use GraphQL as the query language for the front end of the application, such as the web browser or the user software, and SQL as the query language used by a GraphQL server to fetch or update data in a database.

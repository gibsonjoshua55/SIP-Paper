\section{Introduction}

Programming is so often a balance of writing original functionality while abstracting away often repeated code.  This balance is a delicate game.  Leave the developer with too much control and the lack of abstraction makes implementing new features difficult.  Every little bit of functionality has to be re-written for the new context.  On the other hand, too much abstraction leaves the developer with little ability to adapt to their specific situation.

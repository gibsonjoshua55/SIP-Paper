This project seeks to develop a framework to minimize the amount of code required from developers to enable data fetching and mutation on a relational database.  Instead of manually generating SQL queries to interact with the database, GraphQL queries are translated to SQL by the framework.  Using technologies such as GraphQL, SQL, Nest.js, and Type GraphQL, a set of reusable classes and functions are proposed that should ultimately reduce the amount of repetitive code in APIs developed for web-enabled applications. This project was developed within the context of a personal project, Practice Liszt, and throughout an internship and part time position at Maestro LLC in Kalamazoo, Michigan.  The framework proposed by the project is limited in its current GraphQL parsing ability but shows strong potential to integrate with these existing technologies to enable developers to extend the base creating, reading, updating, and deleting functionality.  In addition to the future improvements in GraphQL parsing in this project, other future framework features such as sorting, pagination, and filtering are discussed.

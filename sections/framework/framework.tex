\section{Framework}
With the ability to map queries from GraphQL to SQL, the process of fetching data is reusable throughout the whole application; however, the developer would still have to set up a function known as a resolver to reach out to the database based on the results of the \verb!ConstructIncludes! function.  This would again create duplicated code that this project has sought to remove.  To simplify this process, this project proposes the use of a \verb!BaseEntity!, \verb!BaseService!, and \verb!BaseResolver! that when used together automate the process of creating queries and mutations for a given data type, fetching the data from the database, and returning the data to the client.  These classes are created using tools provided by Nest.js (see Section \ref{sec:nest-js}) and the library it uses to create GraphQL severs, Type-GraphQL.  By taking advantage of these libraries, this framework could be integrated into any server built using Nest.js.  Moreover, these classes are extensible to allow custom functionality and extension by the developer.

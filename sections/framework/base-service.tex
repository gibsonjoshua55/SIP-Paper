\subsection{Base Service}
With a standard structure for the data model of each type of data being stored, we can also create a standard set of functions related to creating, reading, updating, or deleting these records.  Once the data model has been established, Sequelize, the library used to define the data model, provides a set of functions that directly interact with the database such as \verb!findOne!, \verb!findAll!, \verb!create!, etc.  The \verb!BaseService! wraps these functions to provide additional functionality, as well as enforce standard interface with which to interact with the data.

\subsubsection{Merge Options}
When making queries to the database with Sequelize, the client is allowed to pass in options to modify the behavior of the query.  For example the options shown in Figure \ref{fig:merge-options} are all examples that either include data of related tables in the request (through an \verb!include! option) or limit the data that is returned (through \verb!where! options).  Throughout the \verb!BaseService! class, it would be useful to is together two different sets of options.  For example, the application may allow the user to search for a timestamp label by its name; however, the user should only have access to labels that they created.  To achieve this, on each call to the database, the application can merge in the option \verb!{ where: {createdById: user.id}}! so all requests have that constraint.  Because options are a mix of objects, such as \verb!where! options, and arrays, such as the \verb!include!, the logic to merge these options becomes somewhat complicated.  The solution I came to, however, is to do a deep merge on object values and to iterate through \verb!include! options and either add a distinct model to the array, or deep merge matching models.  A deep merge is where the keys and values at each level of an object are combined. On each level, if both objects have the same key, their values are merged as well.  On leafs of the tree, meaning individual values instead of nested objects, one object's value is chosen to have the overriding value, and its value is used in the final result.

For certain parts of the query options, however, this default behavior doesn't work.  For \verb!include! options, you can't simply combine the \verb!include! arrays from the merging options.  This would potentially result in related tables being added multiple times.  Instead you have to union the two sets together and merge common tables. For example, if one \verb!include! joins the \verb!TimestampCollection! table and another include joins the the \verb!User! table and the \verb!TimestampCollection! table, the result should join the \verb!User! table and the \verb!TimestampCollection! table where both options for the \verb!TimestampCollection! table have also been merged.

On \verb!where! options, the two \verb!where! clauses are simply wrapped in an \verb!AND! operator.  This allows both constraints to be applied, but no merge has to be computed.

Figure \ref{fig:merge-options} gives an example of what the outcome of this function would be for two example options.

const initialOptions = {
    include: [{
        model: RelatedModel
    }]
    where: {
        createdById: 10
    }
};

const optionsToBeMerged = {
    include: [{
        model: RelatedModel,
        include: [{
            model: ASecondModel
        }],
        where: {
            createdById: 10
        }
    }],
    where: {
        name: 'A Value'
    }
};

const optionsAfterMerge = {
    include: [{
        model: RelatedModel,
        include: [{
            model: ASecondModel
        }],
        where: {
            createdById: 10
        }
    }],
    where: {
        [Op.and]: 
        [
            {
                createdById: 10
            },
            {
                name: 'A Value'
            }
        ]
    }
}
    \end{Verbatim}

\subsubsection{Base Find Options}
With the ability to merge query options, the \verb!BaseService! provides a mechanism of not only overriding the standard behavior of requests on each method call, but it also provides the option to set base-level constraints on each query.  When extending the \verb!BaseService! class, the subclass can override a function called \verb!getBaseFindOptions!.  This function is called for every fetch to request data from the database and the options it returns are merged into the options provided by the caller.  A common use case for this would be to use this function to ensure that the user can only access records they created.  Looking at the example service in Appendix \ref{ex:tl-service}, we can see how crucial this ability to limit access is.  For Timestamp Labels, they should only be viewable by the user that created that label, or by any user if its collection is marked as public.  By defining a \verb!getBaseFindOptions! method on an implementing service, that logic is applied to all access operations on this object type.  

This is one of the largest benefits of this framework versus Hasura or JoinMonster.  Since functionality is kept in extendable classes, this kind of behavior can be modified for each type defined in the application. Additionally, because the data model defined in the entity is defined for a fully functional ORM, the developer can use that same data model to modify the functionality of their service. No re-definition has to occur.
